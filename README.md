# üõ°Ô∏è Cybersecurity Home Lab with pfSense, Kali Linux, and Ubuntu

## **Overview**

This project demonstrates a realistic **cybersecurity home lab** built with VirtualBox to simulate, analyze, and defend against network attacks. The lab includes a pfSense firewall acting as the security gateway, a Kali Linux attacker machine, and an Ubuntu victim machine, all connected in a segmented network.

The lab models a real-world scenario of perimeter security, simulating a Denial-of-Service (DoS) attack, analyzing it with Wireshark, and mitigating it using firewall rules. This is a highly valuable hands-on environment for anyone interested in network security, blue team operations, or ethical hacking.

## **Key Features & Uses**

‚úÖ Simulate a secure network perimeter with pfSense
‚úÖ Learn network segmentation and routing concepts
‚úÖ Practice launching and defending against DoS attacks
‚úÖ Observe live packet captures with Wireshark
‚úÖ Build, test, and validate firewall rules
‚úÖ Safely test security tools without harming a production network
‚úÖ Develop skills relevant to SOC analysts, blue-teamers, or cybersecurity students

---

## **Benefits**

* **Hands-on skills**: Configure, monitor, and defend a network from real attack tools
* **Safe environment**: Contains attacks within an isolated lab
* **Portfolio project**: Shows practical skills to potential employers
* **Repeatable**: Easily reset and rerun scenarios as needed
* **Low cost**: Runs on free software (VirtualBox, pfSense, Kali, Ubuntu)
* **Realistic practice**: Mirrors real SOC and blue-team processes

* Windows/macOS/Linux with administrative privileges
* VirtualBox 7.x or higher

‚úÖ **ISOs to Download**

* pfSense Community Edition (CE) 2.7.x
* Kali Linux (latest)
* Ubuntu 22.04 Desktop

‚úÖ **Network Setup**

* Bridged network for pfSense WAN and Kali
* Internal network (`LabNet`) for pfSense LAN and Ubuntu

‚úÖ **Software**

* Wireshark (on Ubuntu victim)

## **How it Works (High Level)**

1. **pfSense** acts as the firewall between the attacker (Kali) and the victim (Ubuntu).
2. **Kali** launches DoS traffic towards the victim.
3. **Ubuntu** uses Wireshark to analyze the attack.
4. **pfSense** is configured with rules to block the attacker‚Äôs traffic and logs the blocking events.

This process demonstrates the complete incident response workflow ‚Äî from detection to mitigation.
